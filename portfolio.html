							<h3>Ninja Frog Against Gravity</h3>
							<p>
								For the last project of my bachelors degree I developed a videogame using Unity by myself.
								The goal of this thesis was to learn more about video game development. More specifically, to learn more about each of the branches of the process.
								I also learned how to publish a game, and by taking a single project through every stage of development I got a sense of what a full production pipeline looks like.
								Overall, this project really showed me the importance of both adaptability and a good preproduction phase.
								What I take away the most is the foundation this task gave me for future projects.

							<h3>Dune: Special Spice OPS</h3>
							<p>
								I took part in a collaborative environment in which all the students in the class where grouped together to develop a video game in a selfmade custom engine along the semester.
							</p>
							<p>
								The idea for this subject was for it to share the closest resemblance to a real work environment and to put our teamworking skills to the test, as well as to get a real understanding of how the communication between teams should be handled.
								We were separated into the art, design and development departments, each with a team lead, and a student who took the role of the producer for the project.
								We developed an engine and then used said engine to develop a game.
							</p>
							<p>
								As part of the development team, I mainly had the role of Gameplay Programmer. My job for the first two months was implementing the Lua scripting system into our engine. After that I was in charge of gameplay.
								I developed the script components which integrated the Lua language into the engine.
							</p>
							<p>
								As soon as the scripts were ready to go I started working on the gameplay. I worked on the three characters, on the enemies interaction with the players and the behaviour of some of the enemies.
								As I was the one who integrated Lua into our engine, I also tried to be there to help my teammates understand the system and use it to its full potential.
								I also worked a bit on shaders and was in charge of the scenes transitions.

							<h3>The Mandalorian: Sands of Arvala</h3>
							<p>
								In this project I learned a lot of new skills, adding new features in different places, like using OpenGL to render 2D and 3D at the same time.
							</p>
							<p>
								This has been the first time I have worked on a team with more than 3 programmers and we had to maintain active communication and cooperation.
