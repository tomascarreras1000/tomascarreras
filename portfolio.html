						<h3>Ninja Frog Against Gravity</h3>
						<p>
							For the last project of my bachelors degree I developed a videogame using Unity by myself.
							The goal of this thesis was to learn more about video game development. More specifically,
							to learn more about each of the branches of the process.
							I also learned how to publish a game, and by taking a single project through every stage of
							development I got a sense of what a full production pipeline looks like.
							Overall, this project really showed me the importance of both adaptability and a good
							preproduction phase.
							What I take away the most is the foundation this task gave me for future projects.

						<h3>The Force Knights</h3>
						<p>
							I took part in the CITM's 6th Game Jam where I joined a group of friends for the challenge
							of develping a game in just 5 days for which the theme was the "Echo". We had a designer,
							two artists and myself alongside another programmer. We decided to make a 2D platformer
							using Unity so as to focus as much as possible on a single mechanic and thus have the
							potential to get a demo going in just 5 days.
							This was my introduction to game jams and I both had a great time and learned quite a bit.
							It's always nice to work side by side with friends in a cool project but specially with only
							two programmers where you have to bounce ideas off of one another.

						<h3>Kill Bill: House of Blue Leaves</h3>
						<p>
							For the last delivery of the Level Design subject we developed a prototype for a game in
							Unreal 5 where we replicated the "House of the blue leaves" fight scene from Tarantino's
							Kill Bill.

						<h3>Dune: Special Spice OPS</h3>
						<p>
							I took part in a collaborative environment in which all the students in the class where
							grouped together to develop a video game in a selfmade custom engine along the semester.
						</p>
						<p>
							The idea for this subject was for it to share the closest resemblance to a real work
							environment and to put our teamworking skills to the test, as well as to get a real
							understanding of how the communication between teams should be handled.
							We were separated into the art, design and development departments, each with a team lead,
							and a student who took the role of the producer for the project.
							We developed an engine and then used said engine to develop a game.
						</p>
						<p>
							As part of the development team, I mainly had the role of Gameplay Programmer. My job for
							the first two months was implementing the Lua scripting system into our engine. After that I
							was in charge of gameplay.
							I developed the script components which integrated the Lua language into the engine.
						</p>
						<p>
							As soon as the scripts were ready to go I started working on the gameplay. I worked on the
							three characters, on the enemies interaction with the players and the behaviour of some of
							the enemies.
							As I was the one who integrated Lua into our engine, I also tried to be there to help my
							teammates understand the system and use it to its full potential.
							I also worked a bit on shaders and was in charge of the scenes transitions.

						<h3>Advanced Graphics Programming Engine</h3>
						<p>
							For the Advanced Graphics Programming subject, we developed a 3D model viewer with a
							deferred renderer as well as some techniques learned in class such as normal mapping.
							I learned about many computer graphics techniques and especially about shaders.

						<h3>Beat Hero</h3>
						<p>
							For the final project of the Virtual Reality subject we developed a demo for a VR game
							inspired by Beat Saber. We originally wanted it to be a game about the rithm but,
							unfortunately, for the demo the music is not in sync with the game. Nevertheless, we did
							achieve an entertaining VR demo with some cool features. We used Unity for the development
							as well as the Oculus Quest.

						<h3>The Mandalorian: Sands of Arvala</h3>
						<p>
							In this project I learned a lot of new skills, adding new features in different places, like
							using OpenGL to render 2D and 3D at the same time.
						</p>
						<p>
							This has been the first time I have worked on a team with more than 3 programmers and we had
							to maintain active communication and cooperation.

						<h3>Strawberry Engine</h3>
						<p>
							The Videogame Engines subject consisted of developing a custom videogame engine-like 3D
							model viewer alongside a semester in teams of two.
							For this purpose, Strawberry Engine was developed. We worked with Dear ImGui for the
							interfaces and we used our own rendering system and custom format files to store info of any
							.fbx you wanted to upload to it.

						<h3>Fatal Fury II</h3>
						<p>
							The first Project we did was a remake of the famous Fatal Fury II, from 1992. Using SDL, we
							developed the project in C++. This was the first game we worked on and I learned more on
							this one project that I did on all the rest of subjects that year combined.
